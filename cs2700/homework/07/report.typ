The medical community has professed that any non-zero degree of lead exposure at
early ages will cause a decrease in brain volume as well as intellectual and
cognitive capacities. Because of the nature of the topic, there are no
randomized studies on the impact of lead on cognitive capacities, which makes
it hard to determine the validity of such claim. Even so, literature of
observational studies on the topic is large and varied, which makes it a good
candidate to test Rosembaun's causal inference model of multiple strands.

== Study in Cincinnati

One of the studies I've analyzed, published on May 27, 2008 and titled "Decreased
Brain Volume in Adults with Childhood Lead Exposure" (Cecil et al.), recruited a
sample of children $n = 157$ through the Cincinnati Lead Study, "an urban,
inner-city cohort with detailed prenatal and postnatal histories of low to
moderate lead exposure and behavioral outcomes monitored over 25 y[ears]."
The histories included childhood lead blood concentrations #footnote[Measured
    every 5 months until age of 5, and less frequently for older ages.], MRI
brain scans to asses gray and white matter, demographics #footnote[Includes age,
    sex and socioeconomic status], maternal data #footnote[Includes maternal IQ,
    gestational age and substaces use.], as well as other neuropsychological
markers. #footnote[Includes motor control, IQ, learning, memory, attention and
    visuoconstruction skills.]

The study observed

1. a positive linear association between gray matter volume and
  neuropsychological factor scores for both sex,
2. a significant, negative linear relationship in males between gray matter
  volume development in prefrontal cortex and other wares, and childhood lead
  exposure,
3. no significant results in females.

While the study collected and aggregated over an impressive amount of data, the
cohort nature (everyone lived near Cincinnati), as well as the unknown nature of
the assigment mechanism (how exactly were the kids exposed to lead) supposes the
main barriers to conclude about the causal relationship between lead and
congition.

== Study in Boston

If we were to follow Rosenbaum's counsel of looking for complementary strands
of evidence in order to infer causality, we must look into other cohort studies
performed in other geographical locations. Such is the case with a study
performed in Boston published on 2011 titled "Low-level environmental lead
exposure in childhood and adult intellectual function: a follow-up study".
Similar to the Cincinnati study, a cohort of 249 children born in Boston between
1979 and 1981. From that cohort, only $n = 43$ adults were neuropsychologicaly
tested. Data collected includes blood lead concentration #footnote[measured at
    birth, 6 months, 1, 2, 4 and 10 years.], IQ measurements #footnote[including
    Full-Scale, Verbal an Performance.], demographics, personal and materal
history.

The results were similarly to those of Cincinnati: high blood lead
concentrations at different stages negatively linearly associated with all IQ
markers. The study didn't find (or failed to note, which is unlikely) any
variation of significance across sex, a piece of evidence that complements
the Cincinnati study. The study also has it's deficiencies: it was noted that
both the coefficient of the relation as well as its significance changed. The
study concluded that while most of the results were significant, the magnitude
of the sample size, as well as the unpredicted variations of the coefficient
when conditioned upon maternal IQ could deem the results inconclusive. But the
fact that this results matched closely with those of Cincinnati give us a hint
that the causality might be more sound than apparent by the individual results.
Even so, one might find the results of this combination unsatisfactory to
determine causality. A third, more robust study, would prove to be the answer.

== One study to bind them all

The last study to consider, published on March, 2005 with the title "Low-Level
Environmental Lead Exposure and Children's Intellctual Function: An
International Pooled Analysis", was undergone by a consortium of different
organizations and researchers across the globe, which included and pooled data
from Boston, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Ohio, Mexico City, Australia, Rochester and
Yugoslavia. The variables collected in these location were similar to the ones
in studies described before.

The study return similar results: negative association between different IQ
measures and blood lead concentrations during childhood. It was also found that
the covariates (including those extracted from maternal history) "contributed
very little to the overall fit of the model of the model, and their inclussion
in the model resulted in virtually no change to the coefficient for blood lead",
with none of them being statistically significant. The sensitivity of the study
was assesed by comparing both random-effects and fixed-effects versions of the
models, which had similar results. Even more, the models were fitted in
7-combinations and compared, still yielding similar results.

== Conclusion

The results across this three different studies, performed with slightly
different sets, yielded very similar results. Which lead us to believe that
there is an effective negative linear cause and effect between the blood
lead concentration during childhood and IQ, as well as other markers for
cognitive capabilities.
