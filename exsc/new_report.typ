Zone 2 heart rate training is a low-intensity endurance workout (~60-70% of max Heart Rate) that relies on the oxidative energy system to produce aerobic energy. This form of training requires mantaining a moderate effort over long durations. Some examples of exercises that can be "considered" or included in a Zone 2 session are walking, jogging, cycling, swimming, and hiking at a moderate pace. The idea underneath it is to target a heart rate zone that is sufficiently intense to stimulate the oxidate energy system but not so taxing that it leads to early fatigue. Thus, Zone 2 training help improve endurance capacity and metabolic efficiency, performance of the aerobic system through fat oxidation, glycocen (a type of carb, for the friends) preservation and increased mitochondrial density, making Zone 2 training essential for both athletes and general fitness. To better understand the nature of Zone 2, we could compare it to Zone 1 trainings and see the differences.

Zone 2 HR trainings differs from Zone 1 HR trainings mainly in its intensity. Zone 1 HR training occurs at a heart rate of 50-60% of an individual’s max heart rate, allowing holding conversations with ease. The primary fuel source in Zone 1 is fat, and the energy demands are fully met through aerobic metabolism. While Zone 1 is beneficial for recovery and general health, its training effect is relatively limited in terms of endurance performance improvements.

Zone 2 HR training, on the other hand, occurs at 60-70% of max heart rate and is much more effective for improving aerobic efficiency. At this intensity,the body still predominantly relies on aerobic metabolism, but begins to experience a small but controlled increase in lactate production. While lactate is commonly associated with anaerobic exercise, Zone 2 training maintains lactate at manageable levels, giving the body a chance to clear and recycle lactate, which in turn raises the lactate threshold. This gradual adaptation allows for better endurance and prolonged performance in more intense exercise zones.

A key benefit of consistent Zone 2 training is the enhancement of mitochondrial flexibility and mitochondrial respiration capacity. Mitochondrial flexibility refers to the ability of mitochondria to efficiently switch between fuel sources—fat and carbohydrates—based on energy demands. As the body adapts to Zone 2 training, it enhances its ability to metabolize lactate as an energy source, leading to improved ATP production and endurance. Mitochondria also increase in both density and efficiency, enabling greater energy output with less reliance on glycogen.

For the skeptics, a quote from an academic paper. As noted by Smith et al. (2018), "Exercise can improve mitochondrial health by increasing mitochondrial content, increasing the transcriptional activity of mitochondrial proteins such as PGC-1α, and decreasing ROS production. A 16-week aerobic exercise program as an intervention in both men and women showed an increase in CS and cytochrome c oxidase of 45% and 76%, respectively, as well as an increase in the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis, such as PGC1α (55%), NRF-1 (15%), and TFAM (85%)." For the friends: aerobic training, particularly Zone 2, has a positive effect in helping optimize mitochondrial functions and metabolic efficiency in using fuel through the aerobic system. (Guess why is it called aerobic training)

Enhanced mitochondrial function allows the body rely less on glycogen (a type of carb, as mentioned before) stores, instead relying more on fat oxidation for fuel. This adaptation is particularly benefitial for endurance athletes, as it translates into more and sustained energy availability for long-term efforts, preventing early fatigue and improving overall performance.

In summary, Zone 2 heart rate training is a essential component of endurance training, promoting better mitochondrial function, increased fat utilization, and improved metabolic flexibility. By optimizing aerobic capacity and lactate clearance, it serves as an essential tool for athletes and fitness enthusiasts aiming to improve long-term endurance and energy efficiency.
