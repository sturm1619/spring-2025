Obesity has tripled since 1975. It's most prevalent among black women,
Hispanics, white males, black males, then white females. Severe obseity
is more prevalent among women, people between 40-59, non-Hispanic Blacks.

Become obese young is worse than becoming obese old. Conversely, losing weight
in middle adulthood decreases mortality. Lose weight when you can!


A panel of academic experts released an endorsed consensus statement saying:
"Weight _stigma_ damages health, undermines human and social rights, and is
unacceptable in modern societies." (Nature Medicine). Part of the ethos is
the assumption that the condition says something about our personality and
choices: we are lazy, gluttonous and have chosen to gain fat.

= Is it a disease?

"Yes" because:
- Socially communnicable.
- It can emphasize the genetic and environmental factors.
- Sign of abnormal physiology.
- Improves rearch into treatment and intervention.
- Increases risk ofr CVD, hypertension, cancer, gallblader, kidney, lung, skin,
  joint diseases, impaires immune function and sleep disorders. Weight loss
  improves cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose and blood pressure. Increases
  severe illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19.

"No" because:
- The label carries weight stigma.
- The label keeps people from being proactive: "I'm sick, I can't change".
- Accumulating fat is natural.

= Why is it hard to lose weight

== Physiology

To achieved desired weight, you can't just eat less or exercise more:

- Eating less doesn't account for the ghrenlin and leptin. Also, microbiota,
  enzymes and bile acid operations preevent fat storage.
- Exercising more doesn't account for the decreased metabolic rate and increase
  in ghrenlin.

In general, the body conspires to avoid losing weight and spending too much
energy.

Obesity can be "inherited". Some people will gain more weight than others
because of genetic factors. Also, obesity is an epigenetic factor: methylation
affects DNA.


== Cultural and Psychological

Social gatherings revolve around food. Food is a symbol of connection. It may
also be a symbol of abundance. Even then, weight is negatively correlated to
income, especially among children and women.

People use food to manage stress and mental issues. Changing routines and new
demands affect.

== Public Policy

U.S. agricultural policy encourages farmers to produces corn and high fuctose
corn syrup, at expese of fruit and vegetables. Therefore, fruit and veggies'
price has risen.

Policy enforces posting calorie information in products. Experts recommend
changing food pricing, ban unhealthy food advertising and walkable facilities.

= Why can overweight be good?

Overweight people with more blood supply to their fat might be more
metabolically healthy and protected against cardiac diseases. People with mild
obesity (define obesity?) who remains physically fit have reduced visceral fat,
adipose tissue and around muscles, which reduces cardiac diseases.

= What to focus on

We should focus more on fitness and metabolic capacity than weight loss. Also
how much fat, and where it is located. Good goals include checking
blood pressure, WHR, dietary patterns and cholesterol levels.

Caloric restriction alone is more effective than exercise alone. Focus on
lossing 5-10% of total weight over 6 months, 0.5-2 lbs per week. This requires
250-1000 negative calories per day. Vigorous exerise increases RMR and helps
burn extra calories. Resistance training helps mantaining muscle mass and holds
RMR.

Intuitive eating is one of the best techniques for improving diet. Focus on
satiety and hunger cues. Increased food weight helps with releasins leptin.
Processed food make people eat 500 calories more, eat faster and increases
appetite (ghrenlin). Skipping breakfast increases likelyhood of consuming excess
calories. Planning meals and snacks helps.

Reduce portion sizes. Also, reduce added sugars, refined carbs, processed foods
and solid fats. Adding fruits and vegetables and avoiding fried snacks helps.
Multigrain bread are less processed and have higher fiber content. It reduces
energy availability. Raw whole nuts *overestimate* the number of calories
metabolized (around 20%). Good replacement for a snack. Others include canned
diet drinks, powders for shakes and diet food bars.

Some recommended diets are Mediterranean, DASH and a flexible semi-vegetarian.
Keto doesn't work because increases LDL, lack of fiber and micronutrients,
stress on kidney and liver, and changes microbiome.

What to do if portion sizes are big and weight small? Eat somewhere else!

Intermittent fasting extends nighttime fating period and syncs circadin rhythm.
Outcome reduces blood pressure, inflamation, cancer risk, aging and diabetes
risk.

= When gaining is necessary

Women are 4 time more likely to need to gain weight to be at peak health.

- Consuming more protein, healthy fats and complex carbs from whole grains,
  fruits and vegetables.

- Eat more frequent smaller meals.

- Add nutrient-energy dense foods as nuts and avocados. Smoothies are good.

60-65% of daily calories must come from carbs.
