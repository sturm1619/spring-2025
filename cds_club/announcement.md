Hi everyone! I'm the Computational Data Science Club President at UVU. There is much to say, but this time I'm straightforward: we want to get a sense of the best time to meet, and we are polling from all interested parties. That will also help us know how many are interested in joining and participating and get a sense of how big we should plan our activities.

If you want to start supporting the club, consider this the first thing you can do.
