= Netflix: Adult Content

Netflix is one of the most important streaming services of the industry,
offering a diverse catalog of movies and series. It is also notorious for
it's extensive collection of 18+ titles, with over 2000 films and more than
a thousand series hosted (many of them self produced), the greatest among all
streaming services.

Netflix has been adding new content consistently since its inception in 2007,
with many of its titles being new original productions. In 2018, Netflix added
more than 350 new 18+ movies, more than any other streaming service. Other
streaming services, like Disney Plus, do not include any 18+ content in their
catalogs.

Interestingly enough, only a 40% of the director that have realeased content in
Netflix have directed 18+ production. This is because while the main demography
of Netflix are adults, Netflix releases content for all ages.
