# Part One

## First Visual

The first visual facilitates comparing directly proportions within
survived-class between genders. But the same arrange makes it hard to compare
within other arranges of the categories, like among classes within
gender-survived.

It's hard to tell what can be improved when the point of the
chart is not clear from the title (that should be something to consider), but we
could diminished the number of charts if we would make three stacked charts
where we add total dead and total survivors, as this two categories are mutually
exclusive.

## Second Visual

This visual looks better: it's less cluttered, and it facilitates comparing
categories easier; it addresses all the problems from the first one.

The precise data of how many survived per category is lost, and the legend is
very obtuse (everyone know how unnatural does "survived=1" looks). Also, one
can argue that it is unnecessary as the title and the use of color/opacity
guides the understanding (though it's always good to clarify).

## Conclusions

From both visuals, one can infer an association between gender and class to
survival, but it is more apparent from the second one.

# Part Two

Of the two static approaaches, effectivelly, Visual 2b is more intuitive as it
uses shape and direction besides color. It time axis has a clear start and end
(1850 to 2023).

Honestly, I don't see much difference in effectiveness between Visual 2b and
the video from NASA, except for a couple of points: Visual 2b works with a
smaler scale in Celsius $(-0.9^\circ, 0.9^\circ)$, and the distances are more
dramatic, as well as the strength of the color. The animations add some
"neurotism" and urgency, as the dot starts spiraling faster. But this can
also be percieved with how the rate of change of the histogram.
