== Part 1

The following is a reproduction translated into English of a diagram created by
Charles Minard in 1869to visualize Napoleon's army during its 1812 invasion of
Russia.

#figure(image("image-5.png"))

- What data values are encoded in this visual? There are at least 6.

- Describre how each value is presented visually. What visualization techniques
are used to distinguish data values?

- What is the story being told in this figure? Is the figure exploratory or
explanatory?

=== Answer

Some of the dimensions of the data presented include

+ Amount of men entering Russia

+ Amount of men leaving Russia,

+ Location

+ Date

+ Temperature at the time and place of the battle (in Celsius,
Farenheit or Reaumur)

+ distance traveled

The amount of man at given point is presented as two bars with varying width
along time, one including all the men joining the French army during the
campaign at a given point, the other one including all the men leaving.

The diagram represents the course of the march and the places transited.
The diagram also includes a line chart underneath recording the temperaature
at different points in time of the campaign.

It's obvious from the diagram that, as the campaign advanced, the increase in
numbers due to reinforcements droped. Today, it is accepted as history that the
France-Russian invasion was aborted because of the extreme temperatures. But
from this diagram, as we contemplate the history of the temperature the army was
subject with the numbers of the army, there is a negative correlation between
the two dimensions.

The data encoded is the distribution of scores of how "positive/negative" of the
a given word is, as well a its average. The data is presented as a series of
line charts with colored areas in a range from red to green, where red indicates
negativity, and green positivity. The figure is mostly exploratory: there is no
interpretation on the title or the accompaning text.

The data presented encodes the distribution of home price median-to-income
median ratio among the fifty states. It includes two different visualizations:
a heatmap of the United State, and a radial bar chart sorted decreasingly. Both
visualizations use a spectrum of color going from yellow to purple to indicate
the magnitude of the ratio, where yellow is the lowest and purple the highest.
The figure is explanatory: there is not much information hidden, and both the
highest and lowest ratios are highlighted by explainers.

The data encodes the frequency of visits of the 50 most popular articles in
Wikipedia in 2023 and 2024. The data is presented over two bar charts (each
year), organized decreasing descent. There are lines crossing from chart to
chart, signifying the change in the relative order of popularity. Again,
exploratory: The figure only presents the pages, the visits and the relative
change, but it doesn't include explainers; only after exploring one might
realize how, of the top 5 articles of 2024, 3 are related to U.S. Presidential
Election, or how most of the articles are recent movie releases.
