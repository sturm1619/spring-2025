When I was a child, I wanted to be Sherlock. I've always thought of Mr. Holmes
as the definition of a "real" wizard: nothing that he does is inherently
impossible or a mischieveous scheme, and yet his deductions are so strict and
insightful to the point of awe. I would wonder if someone, any man, could
actually do something like that. For Mr. Holmes, there was nothing that would
remain unrevealed. Sherlock also inspired in me another awe: the awe for our
world and its mysteries. How is it that the stars move? How levers work? How
combustion is ignited? How is Jupyter made of gas? How can we know with
certainty what seems magical?

As embarrasing as it may sound, wanting to become Sherlock has been the driving
force of my formal education. And that matters, because understading is not
cheap. To truly, deeply know something to be true, one must invest in pondering,
and never, _ever_, accept easy, cheap answers, nor let questions unresolved.
Many times, this means that I don't get to watch anime, play games or sports,
or hangout with friends; instead, I must spend hours in front of a whiteboard,
a computer, or a piano, wating for the answers to finally come. Or, chasing
answers, my preys, while they are still within reach.

The result of feeding curiosity is, well, curiosity. Just more curiosity. It
might sound disappointing, but in reality, it is rewarding. It's having a
constant hunger that drives you forward, towards greater ambitions and dreams.
And there is little to nothing that can ever stop such increasing desire: no
hard classes, no daunting assignments, no unfair teachers, no unfinishable
challenges. It's my never expiring ticket towards my dreamland: a place where
the milk of knowing or honey of engaging never ceases. I bet even a cat would
thrive there.
