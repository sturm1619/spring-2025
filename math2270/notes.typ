Linear systems
- Non-homogeneous
  - Inconsistent
  - Consistent
    - One solution
    - Infinite solutions
  - Homogeneous (always consistent)
    - One solution (trivial)
    - Infinite solutions (trivial and others)
      - Other solutions are expressed by the general solution


Trace: sum of the main diagonal
